mvc-jquerymobile
================

This demo is an extension of the last chapter in this book http://goo.gl/J3eOo written by https://github.com/jreid01.
The purpose is to show how you can implement the MVC pattern in JQuery Mobile. For simplicity reasons I ommitted to use
other libraries such as RequireJS. Feel free to provide comments and any advice is always welcomed.
